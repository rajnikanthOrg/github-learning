#
# Workflow Name: reusable-build
#
# Description:
# Demonstrates a reusable workflow that other workflows can call with inputs.
# This pattern prevents duplication of common build, test, or deploy logic.
#
# Purpose:
# - Provide a shared workflow that performs a standard set of tasks.
# - Centralize common logic for multiple branches or repositories.
#
# Key Concepts:
# 1) on.workflow_call:
#      - Marks this workflow as reusable.
#      - Defines optional inputs and secrets that callers can pass in.
#
# 2) Inputs:
#      - Callers provide values through the "with:" block in their calling job.
#
# 3) Secrets:
#      - Callers can forward secrets securely using "secrets:" mapping.
#
# 4) Reuse scope:
#      - The workflow can be called from:
#          a) Another workflow in the same repository, or
#          b) A workflow in another repository (using owner/repo reference).
#
# Usage:
# - This workflow alone does nothing until another workflow calls it.
# - See the companion "caller" workflow below for usage.
